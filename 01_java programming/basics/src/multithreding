🔷 1.what is Multithreading?
Multithreading means running multiple parts of a program (called threads) at the same time.

👉 A thread is like a lightweight sub-process of a program.
So instead of doing one thing at a time, a program can do multiple tasks in parallel.

🔷 2. Why Use Multithreading?
✅ To do multiple tasks at once
✅ To improve performance and resource utilization
✅ To make programs faster and more responsive (like UI apps or servers)

✅ Two ways to create a thread:
🔹 A. By extending the Thread class
🔹 B. By implementing the Runnable interface
